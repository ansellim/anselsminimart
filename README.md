# hey there

This is Ansel Lim's CA2 submission for FWD & WMP modules for the Specialist Diploma in Full Stack Web Development.

# what this website is about

the theme of the assignment was food delivery or restaurant food. my previous assignment (CA1) was about a restaurant called Blue Bunny restaurant but i decided to start completely from scratch for this assignment so as to give myself more practice in basic html, css and other web technologies.

My theme:

- the premise of my project is simple: imagine a minimart with products that you can browse through online - and you can add products to the cart which you can then arrange for home delivery for.
- obviously this is not a restaurant but it is somewhat about food delivery so i think it is still in keeping with the assignment specifications.

the website content is obviously very boring, but the main point of the website is to showcase some web technologies, namely:

- basic HTML and CSS
- bootstrap: use of rows/columns, bootstrap classes, etc.
- JQuery
- AJAX: in my Products webpage, i use an AJAX call to populate the bootstrap cards with information from a JSON file that's hosted on my github repository.
- localStorage ('Shopping List') and sessionStorage ('Cart'): try it out by adding some products from the Products webpage and these should show up on the Cart webpage, and then you can 'submit' a form to allow for delivery.
- form elements
- Google Maps API including Directions API
- progressive web app (this website passes the Lighthouse audit)
  - i don't have push notifications

# my design principle/aesthetic

i prefer a very simple design with mostly text and i don't really like too many photos or colors - so, the website has no photos except for the photos of the products on the products page - i realize that this may result in penalties as "images" is part of the marking criteria for FWD - but i don't really like too many images as it clutters up the page.

# what was not done

i didn't have time to make multiple webpages to create "Details" subpages for each of the products in the Products page that would show more information about the products.

# the live website

The website is LIVE at https://ansellim.github.io/anselsminimart/index.html (hosted on github pages)
